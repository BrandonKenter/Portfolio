              After graduating high school, I worked several general labor jobs.
              From 2015 to 2019, I worked as a paint tech at a building
              materials distributor. It took a few years, but I eventually
              realized I wanted to use my brain and challenge myself more. So,
              in 2017, I enrolled at Western Technical College, and in 2019, I
              transferred to the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I
              graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2022.

              to create purposeful review intervals for learning and retaining
              new information in a more efficient manner. I quickly realized,
              however, that there were no tools available that help facilitate
              studying technical interview problems with spaced repetition. So,
              in the beginning of 2023, I started the development of{" "}

              facilitate spaced repetition, and in late 2023, it was launched!

              Outside of software developement, my favorite thing to do is
              jogging. There's nothing quite like the serenity of a golden hour
              jog along the Lakeshore Path in the summer! Yet, in my many years
              of jogging recreationally, I've never done a marathon before. So,
              one of my main goals is to do one before the end of 2024!
